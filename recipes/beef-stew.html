    <h1>Northern Italian Beef Stew</h1>
    <h3>Description</h2>
    <p>This hearty beef and vegetable stew that can be made in the slow-cooker is a family favorite. It is also the backbone for an excellent beef soup, if you actually find yourself with leftovers.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds lean top round, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 large sweet onions, diced</li>
        <li>2 cups large chunks of celery</li>
        <li>4 large carrots, peeled and cut into large rounds</li>
        <li>1 pound crimini mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
        <li>4 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1.5 pounds red potatoes (such as Red Bliss), cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon dried sage</li>
        <li>1 quart beef stock</li>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook beef in batches in hot oil until browned completely, about 5 minutes per batch. Remove browned beef cubes to a plate lined with paper towels, keeping skillet over heat and retaining the beef drippings.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir onion, celery, and carrots in the retained beef drippings until just softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir mushrooms and garlic into the onion mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour red wine into the pan; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Continue cooking the mixture until the wine evaporates, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir tomatoes into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Return beef to skillet with potatoes, basil, thyme, marjoram, and sage. Pour beef stock and tomato sauce over the mixture. Bring the liquid to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer until the beef is very tender and the sauce is thick, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
    </ol>
